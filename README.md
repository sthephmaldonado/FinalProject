# FinalProject

The project combines the useage and visualization of FFT Averages, Oscillator and Audio Input(Mic). 
Audio Input allows us to get audio in from a mic on our computer. Oscillator playing with frequency and amplitude to make our own sounds using frequency and amplitude and changing values to these. FFT analysis takes the audio file analyze it and break it into a data set and apply that data to a visualization(bar chart.
